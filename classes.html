            Eva has been competing in gymnastics for the last six years, first in the Junior Olympic program up through Level 7, then for Cal Club Gymnastics. She also currently teaches the club's beginner class on Tuesdays. Her strengths are on the uneven bars and balance beam, particularly in the areas of dance, flexibility, and static holds. Outside of gymnastics she also has experience in competitive figure skating, many styles of dance, and circus.

My favorite individuals skills to teach to beginners are round offs, front and back flips, and the basics on all the men's events.

          Hi! I'm Sarah and I have been doing gymnastics for the past nine years and coaching for six. I competed up through level 9 before college, and joined the club team when I started Cal. I've coached all levels of recreational gymnastics/summer camps as well as competitive gymnastics on occasion. I have also been the women's team captain of the club team for three years, so feel free to ask me any questions! I have been coaching classes for the club team for three years and have had all skill levels, from complete beginners to more advanced with gymnastics experience. I am always willing to help with any skills or events, but most frequently I coach tumbling such as round-offs, front and back handsprings, and front and back flips. Hope to see you around the gym :) Go Bears!

At 30 years old and two years into gymnastics practice he's determined to prove that it's never too late to start something new and inspire others to follow their dreams, no matter the age. While he doesn't have previous coaching experience, he looks forward to make up for it with lots of enthusiasm and positive energy in his first class on handstands and form.

I have also coached gymnastics for three years prior to coming to Cal at Victory Gymnastics Academy in Southern California.

            Hey all, I'm Connor and I've been doing gymnastics for about four years now. I actually started doing gymnastics at the club and grew to like it immensely. I have also been coaching kids as a job for the past year. I would say my strengths in coaching are basic to intermediate tumbling, uneven bars, beam, and vault. I don't have a lot of experience teaching the mens' events, but I do know enough to give basic instruction on all of them. My favorite skills to teach are back tucks (back flips), front tucks (front flips), and handsprings. I also know how to spot these skills so don't be afraid to ask for help!

            Hi! I’m Sean and I have been doing gymnastics, in some form or another, for my entire life. From couch gymnastics as a child, to boys team as an adolescent, and Cal Club Team member as an adult, I’ve done it all! As for coaching, I have 10 years under my belt of coaching all levels or recreational gymnastics as well as team and club gymnastics. I have been a part of the Cal Club Team, volunteer coaching and competing, for the past three years. My specialty is Floor and Vault and so naturally, my coaching strengths are teaching intermediate/advanced tumbling and vaulting. No need to worry though,  I am knowledgeable and capable of teaching any other apparatus too so don’t hesitate to stop me and  ask for help!! See you around        </div>
